Program: 8 Foodies is a restaurant established in 2020. Due to rush of customers, the waiters 
are not able to manage the food supply appropriately. To help them, create a menu 
ordering system, which allows customers to select the items from the menu and 
compute the total cost of their order. Use switch case for menu ordering and item 
selection. 
Menu includes the following: 
 Burger - ₹150 
 Pizza - ₹200 
 Pasta - ₹120 
 Sandwich - ₹100 
 French Fries - ₹80 
Display the menu to user and allow them to enter the number they wish to order. 
Calculate the total amount after selection of all items. Ask user to enter ‘0’ after 
finishing the ordering of items. 
Code: #include <stdio.h> 
 
void main() { 
    int choice, total_cost = 0, cost = 0; 
 
    // Display the Restaurant Menu 
 
    printf("Menu Card:\n");

    printf("2. Pizza = 200$\n"); 
    printf("3. Pasta = 120$\n"); 
    printf("4. Sandwich = 100$\n"); 
    printf("5. French Fries = 80$\n");
      printf("0. For Finish your Order.\n"); 
 
    while (1) { 
        // Take input as customer choice 
        printf("\nWhatever Do You Wants To Eat Press Correct Number And If You Wants To 
Complete Your Order then Press 0: "); 
        scanf("%d", &choice); 
 
        switch (choice) { 
            case 1: 
                cost = 150; 
                printf("Burger is added to your cart");
